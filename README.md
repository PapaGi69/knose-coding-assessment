Coding Assessment for Knose Application

Applicant: Reginald San Jose

Notes:

"Print divisible by number 5 or 7"

Found a mistake on coding test 1 output of the assessment

9 is not divisible by 5 or 7 and should only return the integer.

"Sorting Method"

Implemented the quick sort method as it is generally thought of as the most efficient 'general' sorting algorithm,
where nothing is known about the inputs to the array, and it's more efficient than other sorting methods.
